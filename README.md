ðŸŽ® About <br> Hi, Teuku Radja. I specialize in game programming, focusing on building core gameplay mechanics, systems, and optimizing performance. While I handle the technical side of game development, including coding and implementation, I collaborate with designers and artists who provide the assets.

I'm passionate about solving programming challenges and ensuring smooth, immersive gameplay, bringing creative ideas to life through coding.
